        BlueJ is a lightweight Java development environment 
        (IDE) designed primarily for beginners. Developed by 
        Michael KÃ¶lling and John Rosenberg, it is widely used 
        for teaching object-oriented programming. BlueJ provides 
        a simple interface with features like visual class
        structure representation, interactive object creation, 
        and easy debugging. It is ideal for learning Java 
        concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance 
        before moving to more advanced IDEs like Eclipse or 
        IntelliJ IDEA.

        Jvdroid is an Android app that allows you to  
        write, compile, and run Java programs on your 
        mobile device. It provides a full offline Java 
        development environment, making it useful 
        for learning Java or coding on the go.
        Features include full offline support, an 
        integrated terminal & REPL for interactive 
        execution, support for third-party libraries 
        via Maven. Since you're focused on web 
        development and JEE preparation, Jvdroid can 
        be useful if you want to practice Java for JEE 
        Mains (if Java is in your syllabus) or backend 
        development (Spring Boot, etc.). However, 
        for serious Java development, a PC with an IDE 
        like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse would be better.
